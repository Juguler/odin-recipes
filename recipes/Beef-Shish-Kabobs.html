        <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p>This shish kabob is made with chunks of marinated beef, mushrooms,
             and vegetables and cooked on the grill. This recipe is the one my
              mom has cooked for as long as I remember. She would probably be
               upset that I shared the recipe, but it is so delicious that I
                think everyone should have a chance to experience it!</p>
        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>½ cup soy sauce</li>
            <li>⅓ cup vegetable oil</li>
            <li>¼ cup lemon juice</li>
            <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon prepared mustard</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
            <li>1 ½ teaspoons salt</li> 
            <li>1 teaspoon coarsely cracked black pepper</li> 
            <li>1 ½ pounds lean beef, cut into 1-inch cubes</li> 
            <li>16 mushroom caps</li> 
            <li>8 metal skewers, or as needed</li> 
            <li>2 green bell peppers, cut into chunks</li> 
            <li>1 red bell pepper, cut into chunks</li> 
            <li>1 large onion, cut into large squares</li>
        </ul> 
        <h2>Directions:</h2>
        <ul>
            <h4>Step 1:</h4>
            <li>Whisk soy sauce, vegetable oil, lemon juice, garlic, mustard,
                 Worcestershire sauce, salt, and black pepper together in a bowl;
                  pour into a resealable plastic bag. Add beef cubes and squeeze
                   out excess air; seal the bag. Marinate in the refrigerator 8 hours
                    or overnight.</li>
            <h4>Step 2:</h4>
            <li>Add mushrooms to the bag; squeeze out excess air and reseal the bag.
                 Marinate in the refrigerator another 8 hours.</li>
            <h4>Step 3:</h4>
            <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate.</li> 
            <h4>Step 4:</h4>
            <li>Remove beef and mushrooms from the marinade, shaking off any excess liquid.
                 Pour the marinade into a small saucepan and bring to a boil over high heat.
                  Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer for 10 minutes; set aside for basting.</li>
            <h4>Step 5:</h4>
            <li>Thread pieces of green bell pepper, beef, red bell pepper, mushroom, and onion onto metal skewers,
                 repeating until all ingredients are skewered.</li>
            <h4>Step 6:</h4>
            <li>Cook the skewers on the preheated grill, turning frequently and brushing generously with the
                 reserved marinade until nicely browned on all sides and beef is no longer pink in the center,
                about 15 minutes.</li>
        </ul>
