        <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p>This shish kabob is made with chunks of marinated beef, mushrooms,
             and vegetables and cooked on the grill. This recipe is the one my
              mom has cooked for as long as I remember. She would probably be
               upset that I shared the recipe, but it is so delicious that I
                think everyone should have a chance to experience it!</p>
